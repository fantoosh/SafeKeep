            <h1>Intro to Password Managers</h1>
            <p>
              Welcome to our password manager and generator website! We understand that it can be difficult to keep track of all the different logins and passwords you use for various websites, which is why we have created a tool to help you manage them securely.
              Our password manager allows users to store and organize their passwords, login credentials, and other sensitive information in a secure, encrypted manner. It is available as a web-based service and to use a vault, you would have to remember only one Username and Password to login
              <br>In addition to storing and generating passwords, SafeKeep also offers a number of other features to help users keep their sensitive information safe.

            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            <p>
              The website has a password manager feature that allows registered users to save logging credentials (username, password, website) for other websites. This information is stored in an encrypted form in the database to ensure the security of the data.
              The website uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm to encrypt the logging credentials stored in the database. AES-256 is a widely used and highly secure encryption algorithm that uses a complex key to encrypt and decrypt data.
              The website also has a password generator feature that allows users to create strong, unique passwords for use on other websites. These passwords are not stored in the database and are provided to the user for their own use.
              Overall, the website provides a convenient and secure way for users to manage their logging credentials for other websites, as well as generate strong passwords for use on those websites. The encryption used ensures that the data stored in the database is protected and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

            <h1>Generate Password</h1>
            <p>
              Generates strong, unique passwords for online accounts: Pgenerator can generate random, secure passwords that meet the requirements of a particular online service or account. This helps users avoid using weak or reused passwords, which are more vulnerable to being hacked.
